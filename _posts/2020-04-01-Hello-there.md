# Hi, I’m Andrew and welcome to my blog!

Here, I’m going to write about anything and everything that I feel like writing about in realm of data science.  I might write…about:
- Concepts
- Ideas
- Commentary
- Tutorials
- My fun data science projects that I’m doing,
- *Anything data science related really,*
- My DS career, perhaps.

At the end of the day, *this is an outlet for me to streamline my understanding of data science and as a knowledge bank for myself.* Hopefully, others may find this blog, would like to read some of my content, and actually leave the blog learning about something cool.

There isn’t a set schedule, but I will post as much as I can, and as of April 2020. I hope to put out 2 posts a week!
## A bit about myself
*I’m someone who’s passionate about data and utilizing data to make better decisions.* That’s what data science is about in my opinion. I started my journey roughly a year ago, enrolling myself in [Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/), participating in their Data Science 12 week bootcamp. Learned a lot, but it was my foundation into this world. I was grateful to get the opportunity to come back after I completed the program to be a Data Science Teacher Assistant for BrainStation. Helping others learn this craft from the same place I learned it and today was my last day as a TA….one year later from when I started. A full circle and kinda poetic.

I know I’m fairly new in this field, but in a span of year I’ve learned a lot and I want to share this knowledge from someone like me.

My background is in business, I went to a business school and that is still very much a part of me. *To me, Data Science is the intersection of business and technology, and I want to establish myself in there.*

Enough me, if you read this far! Thank you and I hope you enjoy all my other posts! :blush
