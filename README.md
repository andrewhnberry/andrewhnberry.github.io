## Welcome to my Blog!

This blog will be a little extension to my data science life.

## About Me
I'm a data science enthusiast with a particular interest in Natural Language Processing and analytical work that has business impact. 


## Data Science Blog
I've taken an interest in blogging about data science and python programming related topics. **I have published a few articles on Towards Data Science**, one of the biggest publications for Data Science on Medium. [Check out my latest articles here](https://towardsdatascience.com/@andrewhnberry).

I generally publish more frequently on my personal blog called Berry's Thoughts, which you can check out [here.](https://andrewhnberry.github.io)

## Data Science Portfolio
Below is a list of my latest projects encompassing my portfolio.  

#### Data Science End-to-End projects
Name  | Description  | link  |  Notes
--|---|---|--
Can LDA modeling techniques and sentiment analysis be used to determine media bias? (Recently Updated)| My very first full Data Science project I uploaded on Github! It was my way my first taste into NLP methodologies, for more information check out the gitub repository. I'm quite proud of it!  | https://github.com/andrewhnberry/Fake-Job-Detection  |  
Are you a bad debter?| A classic end-to-end exploratory data analysis project on the Lending Club loan data, trying to figure out which features make you a bad debter. There includes various models trying to predict bad debt as well. A classic end-to-end data science project.  | https://github.com/andrewhnberry/Identifying-bad-debt  |  
Which of these job postings are fake?| As with many folks during this COVID-19 pandemic, folks have been laid off or out of job, a position that I am currenlty in. From time to time browsing at job boards, you would encounter a sketchy looking posting and I was wondering if I could make a machine learning model to determine if a job posting was fake. A classic end-to-end data science project.  | https://github.com/andrewhnberry/Fake-Job-Detection  |  
NBA 2019 Data Science Hackathon| I participated in the 2019 NBA Data Science Hakathon. It was a classic regression machine learning problem.  | https://github.com/andrewhnberry/ds-NBAHack-q2/blob/master/NBA_q2_Andrew.ipynb  |  

#### Mini Projects:
When I'm not working on a full fledged data science project, I sometimes do mini projects. Usually along the lines of exploratory data analysis, SQL, and storytelling. It helps me keep my skills sharp, and learn new ones.

Name  |Description   |  Link |  Notes
--|---|---|--
Data_Manipulation_Cases  | A collection of SQL and Pandas exercises, to hone my skills.  |  https://github.com/andrewhnberry/Data_Manipulation_Cases |  
Visualization_Tuesdays  | A collection of EDA projects, and data visualization exercises. |  https://github.com/andrewhnberry/Visualization_Tuesdays |
